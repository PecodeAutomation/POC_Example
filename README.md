# Directory structure

- **_tests_** - contains e2e test files 
- **_components_** - contains the page selectors and uses them to create methods such as create something new, edit something, delete something etc.
- **_fixtures_** - allows to put reusable behavior such as custom commands or global overrides to extended test function that you want applied and available to all of your tests
- _**playwright.config.ts**_ - This file is used to store any configuration values you supply.
